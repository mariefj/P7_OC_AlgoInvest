# AgoInvest&Trade

### Description

This project has been realized as part of a project of the course
'Application developer - Python' of OpenClassrooms.

The goal was to write two algorithms to find the best combination of stocks to invest in to have the best benefice after 2 years.
Each stock can be bought only once, for the first algo, we have to compare every combinaisons possible.
In the second, this second rule is no longer mandatory.

#### SETUP :

First, start by cloning the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:mariefj/P7_OC_AlgoInvest.git
```

- Access the project folder
```
cd P7_OC_AlgoInvest
```

- Start
```
python bruteforce.py filename.csv
python optimized.py filename.csv
```

Some advice : As the first algo tests every combinaisons, you don't want to give a large dataset, or make sure you take a veeeryyy long coffee break...
